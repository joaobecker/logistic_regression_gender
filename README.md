# Gender Identification - Logistic Regression

##### This project uses Logistic Regression to identify people's gender by using height and weight as feature.

### Results - 
##### The project uses cross-validation techniques to find the optimal parameter C for the logistic regression. After running the parameter tuning model we are able to increase the accuracy of the model to 0.9256.
